    <p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. 
    In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, 
    regardless of their culture of origin. While some of the oldest pieces of origami have been 
    found in ancient China and its deepest roots are in ancient Japan, origami can make an impact 
    in today's education too. This art form engages students and sneakily enhances their skills, 
    including improved spatial perception and logical and sequential thinking.</p>
